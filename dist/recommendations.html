    <p>
      Here you will find various media that I think most people would enjoy.
      Some are works by creators you've mostly likely heard of before like J. R.
      R. Tolkein or Hayao Miyazaki. In this case I'm trying to promote the
      appreciation of some of their lesser-known creations.
    </p>
    <h2>Books</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Children of Húrin</i> by J. R. R. Tolkein &#8212; Ages before
        <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy in a land
        called Beleriand, Morgoth's evil will is creeping across the kingdoms of
        Men and Elves. <i>Children of Húrin</i> is grim and its protaganists are
        cursed. The story is more akin to a Greek tragedy than the mirth of
        <i>The Hobbit</i>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Cloud Atlas</i> by David Mitchell &#8212; Six wildy different stories
        from various locations and time periods are brilliantly interwoven in a
        way that you don't really begin to understand until you've nearly
        completed the book.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Endurance</i> by Alfred Lansing &#8212; An absolutely incredible
        story about the survival of the members of the ill-fated
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Trans-Antarctic_Expedition"
          >Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition</a
        >. The often-quoted (though never verified) advertisement:
        <i>
          &quot;Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long
          hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and
          recognition in event of success.&quot;
        </i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Grokking Algorithms</i> by Aditya Y. Bhargava &#8212; In my opinion
        this is the best introduction to algorithms. The author does a fantastic
        job with his illustrations breaking down basic concepts like Big O
        notation, sorts, and data structures. The book isn't comprehensive (e.g.
        it doesn't really cover searches) but I don't think that's a bad thing
        for what it is: a great introduction.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>The Three-Body Problem</i> by Cixin Liu &#8212; My favorite sci-fi
        novel written within the decade. If you're a fan of physics, computer
        science, or just interested in an original story concerning contact with
        extraterrestrial intelligence, pick this one up.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>A Wild Sheep Chase</i> by Haruki Murakami &#8212; A divorced
        advertiser receives a photo of a sheep. After publishing it, he is
        contacted by a well-connected individual who sends him on a quest to
        track down that sheep. I could have easily listed 3 or 4 Murakami novels
        here but I think this one makes a great introduction to his style of
        prose and magical realism.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Film and Television</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>The Castle of Cagliostro</i> by Hayao Miyazaki &#8212; Definitely not
        one of Miyazaki's greater known works, but still has his charm,
        nonetheless. The film starts off with our protaganist, Lupin, who robs a
        casino only to find out the money is counterfeit. This leads him to the
        fictional microstate of Cagliostro where he manages to foil a tyrant,
        elude an Interpol inspector, and save a princess from an arranged
        marriage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</i> by Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan, and Steven
        Soter &#8212; Are you a fan of educational documentaries like BBC's
        <i>Planet Earth</i>? If so then you ought to give <i>Cosmos</i> a try.
        While there is a recent reboot featuring Neil deGrasse Tyson, I have not
        seen it and therefore cannot comment on it. Carl Sagan, the narrator,
        eloquently explains in layman's terms the nature of our universe and our
        humble place in it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Dark</i> by Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese &#8212; This show focuses
        on a small German town and starts with a boy going missing. There's a
        cave, conspiracy, and time-traveling. <i>Dark</i> is indeed dark. If you
        watch this, I recommend putting on the original German audio with
        English subtitles as the dubbed English version is out of sync just
        enough to be annoying.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Dawn Wall</i> by Josh Lowell and Peter Mortimer &#8212; The best
        climbing documentary I've seen. Beautifully shot and the story of how
        Tommy Caldwell and Keven Jorgeson came to climb the <i>Dawn Wall</i> in
        Yosemite is inspiring.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>The Detectorists</i> by Mackenzie Crook &#8212; This series is a
        comedy about a couple of metal detector<b>ists</b> in rural England. I
        never knew I wanted to try my hand at metal detecting before watching
        this show. Take note of the shows beautiful opening theme by Johnny
        Flynn.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Midnight Diner</i> by Yarō Abe &#8212; I really don't know how better
        to describe this than saying it's like a wholesome Japanese version of
        Cheers. Each episode of <i>Midnight Diner</i> focuses on a dish that the
        chef makes and this is usually tied in somehow to the lives of his
        patrons. It's such a great show. I really don't understand how this
        isn't promoted by Netflix more.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>*****</i> by Les Cowboys Fringants &#8212; It's really hard to pick a
        singular album from this <i>Québécois</i> folk-rock band. Check out a
        couple tracks like <i>Pizza galaxie</i> or <i>Entre deux taxis</i> and
        branch out from there. Even if you're not so savvy on the French
        language, their sounds are catchy enough to keep you hooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>*****</i> by Johnny Flynn &#8212; Once again I couldn't pick a single
        album so I'll leave you with a few track recommendations from this
        folksy Brit: <i>Tickle Me Pink</i>, <i>Fol-De-Rol</i>, and
        <i>In Your Pockets</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Eusa</i> by Yann Tiersen &#8212; Perhaps better known for his work on
        the soundtracks of <i>Amélie</i> or <i>Good Bye, Lenin!</i>, his studio
        albums are world-class on their own right. <i>Eusa</i> is inspired by
        Ushant, an island off the coast of Yann Tiersen's native Brittany.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Innerspeaker</i> by Tame Impala &#8212; Looking for a psychedelic
        cross between The Beatles and The Doors? Give this one a spin.
